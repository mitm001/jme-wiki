The beginner tutorials demonstrate the most common use cases and explain basic concepts. We encourage you to run the sample codes and experiment with them. link:https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/tree/master/jme3-examples/src/main/java/jme3test[All example code] is included in the jMonkeyEngine SDK: Simply create a new project from the xref:sdk:sample_code.adoc#the-jme3tests-project-template[JmeTests] template.

To start writing your own projects, create a new file from the `BasicGame` template.
Note that Test apps in this example project are not necessarily the recommended way to build an app with JME, they are just simple one class test case that showcase a feature.
