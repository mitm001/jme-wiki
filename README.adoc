== Contribute

There are a few simple rules to follow when contributing.

. It's not required but it's a good idea to give a heads up you made a P/R on the link:https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/[jMonkeyEngine Forum] under the `Documentation` topic.
. When adding documents, make sure to always complete the header of your document first.
. The docs are modular so you can create your own Antora site playbook and module and it can be included in the wiki and maintained by you. +
See: link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora Docs]. +
You can create modules and submit them here also.

The wiki is an Anotora documentation site. It is recommended that you read at least these paragraphs to inform yourself on how to build pages and submit them for review to the wiki.

== Build & Preview

To set up the Antora environment, you'll need Nodejs (tested with node 12).

From your local wiki directory.

Run:
```
npm install
npm run buildDocs
```

This will install the needed dependencies and run the static site generator. The documentation will be output to the directory `build/site`.

To preview, navigate to the `build/site` directory and open the index.html file in your browser.

see: https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/preview-site/
